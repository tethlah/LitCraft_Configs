LitCraft official server is up!

Some minor changes to support the live server:
- Added our server to the servers.dat file for players to come try out the pack.
- Added the resource packs I personally use so you can get the same visual experience you see in my screenshots.
- Got rid of TinkersConstruct essence bushes.
